# Tail Heding Trading Algorithm

## Project Overview

This repository contains an R project that focuses on advanced financial data analysis, specifically analyzing market return distributions and evaluating the effectiveness of put options as hedging tools. The project leverages historical S&P 500 data to model potential future returns and assess the cost-effectiveness of various hedging strategies. The work combines rigorous statistical modeling, advanced data visualization, and practical applications in portfolio management.

## Features

- **Market Return Analysis:**
  - Calculation and visualization of daily, weekly, and monthly return distributions for the S&P 500.
  - Implementation of bootstrapping to simulate potential future return paths.
  
- **Put Option Hedging Analysis:**
  - Evaluation of put options as hedging tools based on various market downfall scenarios.
  - Computation of profitability, breakeven points, and cost-effectiveness of different put options.
  - Application of statistical methods to estimate the probability of achieving profitability under specific conditions.

- **Advanced Data Visualization:**
  - Detailed visual representations of return distributions using ggplot2.
  - Visualization of portfolio impact and hedge effectiveness across different market scenarios.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have R and the following R packages installed:

```r
install.packages(c("quantmod", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-data-analysis-hedging.git
```

## Usage

1. **Set Up:** Open the R project in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
2. **Load Data:** The project automatically fetches the necessary market data from Yahoo Finance using the `quantmod` package.
3. **Run Scripts:** Execute the R scripts in the following order for a complete analysis:
   - `Market-Return-Distribution-and-Probability.R`: Analyzes S&P 500 return distributions and applies bootstrapping to simulate possible return paths.
   - `Put-Options-Data-Analysis.R`: Computes the profitability of various put options and evaluates their effectiveness as hedging tools.
   - `Put-Option-as-Hedge-Visualization-2.R`: Visualizes the results of the put option analysis, showing the impact on portfolio performance under different market scenarios.

## Data Sources

The project uses historical market data fetched directly from Yahoo Finance via the `quantmod` package. The data includes daily, weekly, and monthly price information for the S&P 500 index.

## Results and Visualizations

The project generates a series of visualizations that provide insights into:

- **Market Return Distributions:** Frequency and probability of returns over different time horizons (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Hedging Effectiveness:** The impact of put options on portfolio performance, visualized across different market downturn scenarios.

These visualizations can be found within the scripts and saved as `.png` files if needed.
